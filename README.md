# lambda_calculus

Parsing and reduction/evaluation for lambda calculus expressions.

## Why?

I'm reading [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) and
to really solidify my learnings I wanted to actually implement everything. This repo is basically
everything I implement while reading the book, so it may evolve into much more than a lambda
calculus program.
